This directory contains all necessary files for the Lammps Automator application.

One can use the full potential of lmp_auto without compiling the python code into a binary, however, for a simpler and more conveniet use a config file is provided to automate such compilation.


Use without installation (compilation):

1. Navigate to a folder with lmp_auto project
2. Use the lmp_auto.py file with a python3 interpriter: pytohn3 lmp_auto.py -h

Use with installation (preferred):

1. Navigate to a folder with lmp_auto project
2. Create a build directory by executing: mkdir build && cd build
3. Run the configuration file: ../configure --prefix=/path/to/installation --install-requirements=true
4. Use the lmp_auto binary: lmp_auto.py (make sure the installation directory is in your $PATH variable by executing: echo $PATH

Instructions for setup file format:
To create an empty setup file run the generator command as if the file is already there:
$lmp_auto generator -sf setup.txt
This is going to give you and error and create an empty file with a discriptive header for you.

Use the names (without dashes) that appear in the help messages for specifying the input parameters.

Example of a setup.txt file:
#Beginning of a setup file
molecules_dict = {"SiO2":80, "H2O":20}
m = 15
density = 3.02
#End of a setup file

Valuable notes:
When specifying a setup file one can also pass positional arguments to lmp_auto like so:

$lmp_auto generator -sf setup.txt -ff true -d 1.8

The arguents' values that were present in the setupfile will be overwritten with the respective values specified by the positional arguments. (In the case above density will be taken as 1.8)
